# My Algorithms

Welcome to the "My Algorithms" repository! This repository contains implementations and optimizations of various algorithms, starting with an optimization of selection sort.

## Introduction

In this repository, I explore different algorithms and techniques to solve common computational problems. My focus is on providing clear, well-documented implementations that showcase both traditional algorithms and innovative optimizations.

## Implemented Algorithms and Optimizations

| Algorithm           | Description                                                                 |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Selection Sort (Optimized) | Optimized version: Simultaneous finding of both minimum and maximum elements |
| (Future Algorithms) | More algorithms and optimizations will be added in the future               |

### Selection Sort (Optimized)

The optimized version of selection sort in this repository simultaneously finds both the minimum and maximum elements in each pass through the array. This approach reduces the number of comparisons and potentially improves sorting efficiency, especially on partially sorted data.

### (Future Algorithms)

More algorithms and optimizations will be added to this repository in the future. Stay tuned for updates and enhancements to further explore various algorithmic techniques and optimizations.
