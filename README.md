# My Algorithms üßÆ

Welcome to the "My Algorithms" repository! This repository contains implementations and optimizations of various algorithms, starting with an optimization of selection sort.

## Description üìö

Explore implementations and optimizations of common algorithms in this repository, where I showcase both traditional approaches and innovative optimizations to solve computational problems efficiently.

## Implemented Algorithms and Optimizations üõ†Ô∏è

| Algorithm           | Description                                                                 |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Selection Sort      | Traditional implementation of selection sort                                |
| Selection Sort (Optimized) | Optimized version: Simultaneous finding of both minimum and maximum elements |
| (Future Algorithms) | More algorithms and optimizations will be added in the future               |

### Selection Sort (Optimized) üöÄ

The optimized version of selection sort in this repository simultaneously finds both the minimum and maximum elements in each pass through the array. This approach reduces the number of comparisons and potentially improves sorting efficiency, especially on partially sorted data.

### (Future Algorithms) üîç

More algorithms and optimizations will be added to this repository in the future. Stay tuned for updates and enhancements to further explore various algorithmic techniques and optimizations.
