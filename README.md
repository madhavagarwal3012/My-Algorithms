### üöÄ Selection Sort (Optimized) 

The optimized version of selection sort in this repository simultaneously finds both the minimum and maximum elements in each pass through the array. This approach reduces the number of comparisons and potentially improves sorting efficiency, especially on partially sorted data.

#### üåü Key Features:
- Finds both minimum and maximum elements in a single pass
- Swaps elements at both ends of the array
- Reduces the number of comparisons compared to traditional selection sort

#### üìä Performance
- Time Complexity: O(n^2)
- Space Complexity: O(1)

This approach aims to reduce the overall number of comparisons, potentially improving efficiency, especially for partially sorted arrays or when dealing with larger datasets.

### üîÑ Array Rotation (Flexible)

This implementation offers a flexible approach to array rotation, supporting both left and right rotations with robust error handling.

#### üåü Key Features:
- Supports both left and right rotations
- Handles rotation amounts larger than array length
- Includes error checking for invalid rotation directions
- Uses a new array for rotation, ensuring clarity and avoiding side effects

#### üìä Performance
- Time Complexity: O(n)
- Space Complexity: O(n)

This approach prioritizes flexibility, clarity, and robustness over absolute space efficiency, making it ideal for most real-world scenarios where these factors are crucial.

### üîç (Future Algorithms) 

More algorithms and optimizations will be added to this repository in the future. Stay tuned for updates and enhancements to further explore various algorithmic techniques and optimizations.

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/madhavagarwal3012/My-Algorithms.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

## üìö Usage

Each algorithm can be used by importing the respective Program file and calling its methods with your data.

To use the algorithms in your Java project:
- Copy the `my_algorithms.java` file into your project's source directory.
- Import the `algorithms.my_algorithms` class in your code.
- Call the desired method, e.g., `my_algorithms.selectionSortBetter(arr)` or `my_algorithms.arrayRotation(arr, rotationSteps, direction)`.
