# My Algorithms 🧮

Welcome to the "My Algorithms" repository! This repository contains implementations and optimizations of various algorithms. Explore implementations and optimizations of common algorithms in this repository, where I showcase both traditional approaches, innovative optimizations as well as new algorithms designed by me to solve computational problems efficiently.

## Implemented Algorithms and Optimizations 🛠️

| Algorithm           | Description                                                                 |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Selection Sort (Optimized) | Optimized version: Simultaneous finding of both minimum and maximum elements |
| (Future Algorithms) | More algorithms and optimizations will be added in the future               |

### Selection Sort (Optimized) 🚀

The optimized version of selection sort in this repository simultaneously finds both the minimum and maximum elements in each pass through the array. This approach reduces the number of comparisons and potentially improves sorting efficiency, especially on partially sorted data.

### (Future Algorithms) 🔍

More algorithms and optimizations will be added to this repository in the future. Stay tuned for updates and enhancements to further explore various algorithmic techniques and optimizations.

## 🛠️ Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/madhavagarwal3012/My-Algorithms.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd My-Algorithms
   ```

## 📚 Usage

Each algorithm can be used by importing the respective Program file and calling its methods with your data.
